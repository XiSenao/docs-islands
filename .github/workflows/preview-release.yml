        #
        # IMPORTANT: Publish from dist/ directory (not package root) because:
        # 1. dist/package.json has been cleaned by packagePlugin.ts during build
        #    - scripts field removed (no build/release scripts)
        #    - imports field removed (internal path mappings)
        #    - devDependencies filtered (workspace: and catalog: protocols removed)
        # 2. Matches production release behavior
        # 3. Users get a clean package.json without development artifacts
        #
        # If published from package root, the uncleaned package.json would be included
        # in the tarball with unnecessary fields (scripts, imports, etc.)
